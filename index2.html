                        <h3>Some Benefits</h3>
                        <p><strong>Increased efficiency:</strong> <em>AI</em> has the potential to automate many tasks, leading to <br>increased efficiency in various industries. For example, AI-powered robots can work<br> around the clock, and they don't get tired or make mistakes</p>
                        <p><strong>Improved accuracy:</strong><em> AI </em>algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data and provide<br> accurate predictions, making it easier to identify patterns and insights that may <br>be missed by human analysts.</p>
                        <h3>Some Risks</h3>
                        <p><strong>Job displacement:</strong><em> AI </em>has the potential to automate many jobs, leading to job <br>losses and the need for workers to retrain for new roles.  </p>
                        <p><strong>Security risks:</strong><em> AI </em>can be used to develop sophisticated cyberattacks, making <br>it more difficult to detect and prevent them.</p>
